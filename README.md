--------------------------------

The game currently features an AI opponent which will make moves randomly. I plan to change that in the future, but for now it is like this. Also another thing to note is that you as the player will always be playing first and as the X's, another thing which will be adressed later one. When the game comes to either a win, lose or a draw, you will need to press the mouse on the window so that it can restart the game for you.
