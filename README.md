--------------------------------

The game currently features an AI opponent which will make moves randomly. I plan to change that in the future, but for now it is like this. You can change whether you are playing as X or as O with a press on the Change Sides button above the grid. The reset button will reset the entire board to an empty one, if you desire to reset before the game is over, you can do that. The last button for Player VS Player is not implemented yet but will be added in the future.

--------------------------------
 The settings/workspace I used for compiling:
  
    Compiler     ---> GCC 7.3.0
    C++ Standard ---> C++17
    IDE          ---> Visual Studio Code
    
--------------------------------
You will need this exact version of GCC to compile the code if you are using VS Code like I am. For Visual Studio, you will need to download the SFML library and connect it to the project settings in the IDE. As for GCC, you will need to set it up as your compiler if you do not have it already. Note that you do not need to download SFML if you will be using this in VS Code, everything is set up in the project files already.
